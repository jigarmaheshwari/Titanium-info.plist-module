Plist Module
============

Simple module to access values from app info.plist at runtime.

I wrote this since there was no way to get the value of CFBundleVersion from your app Info.plist in Titanium.

Example Usage:

var plistmodule = require('com.meeech.plist'),
    appVersion = plistmodule.getValue("CFBundleVersion");

Ti.API.info("CFBundleVersion => " + appVersion);

FYI re. Version info: When running in the simulator, you will basically get back the short version. (ie: 2.0) When you build your .ipa and run on device, then you will get the proper bundle version value (ie: 2.0.1333059581).
